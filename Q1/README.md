# Question 1: Merge Sort

## Running Time of Merge Sort Algorithm

The merge sort algorithm has a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the number of elements to be sorted. This means that the running time of merge sort grows logarithmically with the input size.

## Difference in Running Time with Bubble Sort

If the number of usernames is 10,000 and the program is implemented using bubble sort, the running time would be significantly slower compared to merge sort. Bubble sort has a time complexity of O(n^2), which means the running time grows quadratically with the input size. With 10,000 usernames, bubble sort would require a much longer time to sort the list compared to merge sort.
